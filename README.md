Heart Disease Prediction using GA-NN Hybrid Model
Overview
This project implements a hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Neural Network (NN) model for heart disease prediction. The Genetic Algorithm optimizes the neural network by selecting the optimal hidden layer size, improving model performance. The dataset consists of patient records with risk factors for heart disease, and the model aims to classify individuals as at risk or not.

Features
Hybrid GA-NN Optimization: GA optimizes the NN structure to improve classification accuracy.
Confusion Matrix Analysis: Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
MATLAB Implementation: The project is developed in MATLAB, using built-in GA functions and NN training methods.
Heart Disease Dataset: Uses patient records with medical attributes for training and validation.
